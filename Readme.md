# Go interfaces in python

This repository contains code used for my presentation at Milano python meetup.
I would try to realize something similar to go interfaces in python.
The first thing is to start for an go example. I download and modified the code from go tour.
I build the CPython library using [buildmodes](https://blog.filippo.io/building-python-modules-with-go-1-5/).

To manage the version I have to install [gvm](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/install-golang-on-ubuntu/).

  - first_example.go is the [first example](https://tour.golang.org/methods/4) of the tour.
