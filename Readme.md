# Go interfaces in python


This repository contains code used for my presentation at Milano python meetup.
I would try to realize something similar to go interfaces in python.
The first thing is to start for an go example. I download and modified the code from go tour.
I build the CPython library using [goPy](http://gopy.qur.me/extensions/examples.html).

  - first_example.go is the [first example](https://tour.golang.org/methods/4) of the tour.
